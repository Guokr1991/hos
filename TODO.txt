TODO for Huygen on Speed

Might be abit outdated.

Refactoring:
	- PaintTool class (move array drawing functions into this class)
		- Draw line, freehand, circle and squares with random scatterer (for speckle or phantom generation)
	- Get the name right Huygen's on speed - Huygen on Speed - Huygen' on Speed ???	

Implementation:
	- Slowmov/fastmov switch (changing simulationTimeStep)
	- make a source factory class
	- remove all cuda dependencies from non-GPU-classes
	- controllers for size of deltaTime
	- create Array, ArrayElem and PointSource as subclasses of ISource
	- implement array design tool (look at ultrasim)
	- change user interface (antTweekBar or Qt)
	- read config from xml (rapidXml)

Optimalization:
	- optimize memory transfer (remove bottleneck -> high number of sources (Field II approche?))
	- for directive elements, generate point sources on the GPU to reduce memory transfers (only transfer center-points)
	- rintf (fast float to int conversion)	
	- test instruction load vs memory load (e.g. comment out sin/cos instructions)
	- 1. or 2. order approximation of sin and cos

Done:
(insert newly finished tasks at the top)
- PaintTool class
- CPU-implementation
- Simulator class
- Observation(Space) in its own h/cpp file
- connect to matlab (maybe ultrasim)
- scripting interface (matlab/python)
- cpu implementation
	- DisplayResponse must be made undependent of memory type (cuComplex, CPU vs GPU memory)
- implement use of const and shared vs global memory (shared might benefit from broadcasting feature)
